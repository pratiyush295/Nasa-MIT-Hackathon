➡ FIONE ⬅Drone Surveillance System 🎦 ,
Names made up of Fire + Drone , this is a project a built last October,
You'll might have heard of forest fire causing damages of gazillion magnitude in regions like Australia, Now a solution to better management of such hazards is FIONE, a tool involving three primary tasks 🔥 Forest Fire Detection - 👨‍🚒 Hazard Management - 🚒 Fire Fighter Management.

FIONE Handles and alert all the neighboring locals about the fire through SMS 📲 by classifying RED-YELLOW-GREEN regions arounds the hazard. Red as the name suggest is the highly exposed zone and will be taken care of the fastest with relocation of locals and deployment of fire fighters. Yellow is a potential zone, and green the safe zone. 

🌟 Even locals can raise a fire concern with a picture of the concerned area and and automatic location tracking system Inbuilt in FIONE, Increasing FIONE's reach.

What's different in FIONE?
➡ Developed a Machine Learning model to determine loan eligibility with up to 88% accuracy.
➡Engineered a comprehensive Neural Network fire management tool using OpenCV, YOLO-V8, Django (3.2.4), TensorFlow (2.16.1), and various database systems.
➡Reduced false fire alarms by 40% and improved response times by 25% within the first quarter.
➡Developed a specialized drone surveillance system for fire management in dense forests, enhancing early warning capabilities and rescue operations, cutting response times by 35%.
➡Achieved 88% accuracy in fire detection; focused on web development with Django (3.2.4) backend and integrated other frontend technologies for optimal performance and user experience.
